#### Please Note
This repository is a template and a proof of concept, designed to showcase a future app idea.
The current version is a front-end prototype. Features like exporting stickers directly to WhatsApp are simulated to illustrate the intended user experience.

#### Future Plans
The goal is to evolve this template into a full-fledged application. The future roadmap includes:

#### API Integration: 
Connect to a third-party AI service for automatic background removal on uploaded images.

#### Native Mobile App: 
Develop a simple companion app for Android and iOS to handle the final import of the sticker packs into WhatsApp.

#### Backend Service: 
Build an API to manage user accounts and sticker packs.
